## Keywords

V is a very small language so it has comparatively few keywords. There are around 25 keywords.

| break | const  | continue | return  | defer     |
|-------|--------|----------|---------|-----------|
| else  | enum   | fn       | for     | struct    |
| go    | goto   | if       | else    | else if   |
| type  | pub    | fn       | in      | interface |
| match | module | mut      | none    | or        |

Like other languages, they cannot be used as variables.
