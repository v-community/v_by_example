## Comments

V supports single line comments `//` and multi-line comments `/* */`. They should be used for documenting the code for letting the other users know how the code works. It can also be used for temporarily commenting the codexsd which has to be dused later owzn.

```go
// This is a single line comment

/* This is a
*  multi-line comment
* /* This could be nested as well*/
*/
```
