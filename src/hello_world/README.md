# Hello V

## Using `print`, `println` and `panic`

Like any program we always have to print for getting the output and correct the result if needed to.

- `print`: for printing the text to the output stream without a newline.

- `println`: same as `print` but newline appended automatically.

- `panic`: same as `print` but exits from the program.

## Comments

V supports single line comments `//` and mutli line comments `/* */`. They should be used for documenting the code for letting the other users know how the code works. It can also be used for temporarly commenting the code which has to be used later on.

## Exercises

Try uncommenting the code in `hello.v` and see what happens.
