# Documentation Style Guide

These are the guidelines for writing documentation.

## Titles

-   Each page must have a single `#`-level title at the top.
-   Chapters in the same page must have `##`-level titles.
-   Sub-chapters need to increase the number of `#` in the title according to
    their nesting depth.
-   All words in the page's title must be capitalized, except for conjunctions
    like "of" and "and" .
-   Only the first word of a chapter title must be capitalized.

## Print Width

To be easy to read when editing the markdown code, if the sentence is too long, divide it down.
The recommended column length limit is 80.

## Code Output

To create output from code, there are two rules:

-   If the output is short then put it as a comment

-   If the output is quite long (column) then write it in a separate section after the code section.

## Indentation

Indentation must use spaces and the tab size must be 4.
