# Data Types

V has various basic data types including strings, integers, booleans, etc. Here are some basic data types in V.

## String

Strings are used to represent text. To use strings in V you can simply use `'` or `"`, for example `print(' hello world ')` is equivalent to `print("hello world")`.

## Integer

As the name suggests, integers are used to represent integer values. To use an integer in V is quite easy. Unlike string data types where you have to wrap it in quotation marks `"` or `'`, you can put an integers directly. For example `print(20)`.

## Boolean
Boolean is a data type that has one of two possible values (usually denoted `true` and `false`), intended to represent the two truth values of logic and Boolean algebra.
